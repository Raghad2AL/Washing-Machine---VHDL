# Washing-Machine---VHDL
This is a VHDL code to implement a washing machine system, we had a component which is the divider to divide the frequency, multiple signals to control the washer, we had 7 states for the washer according to the ASM chart we built, each one to describe the flow sequence of the machine and how it washes :P.
